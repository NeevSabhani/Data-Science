The problem with floats is that when doing mathematical operations, with floats, a lot of the time they round after the operation is finished, so while a few operations might be fine, if you do multiple operations, the value will be far off then what the actual value might be. With ints however, there wont be rounding involved therefore they will be more accurate."
